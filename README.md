# Learning Elixir
Thank you for the interest you are taking in our company.
Through the following folders we will try to teach you how to code in Elixir.

## How to start?
Simply fork this repository on your github account.

## What do I need to do?
On each of the folders contained in this repository, you will find a small course (README.md) and a suit of exercises.
Open the `*_test.exs`  to know what is expected from you.
You need to code the solution on the file **without** the `*_test.exs` extension.

## How can I run the tests?
Run in your shell:
```$> elixir my_file_test.exs```

_Note: remove the `$>` and replace the `my_file` with your filename._

## What do I need to work?
## Elixir
You will find clear and clean explanation on the [http://elixir-lang.org/install.html](official website - Install section).

### Editor/IDE
Use any text editor or IDE you prefer. You can find a list of Elixir add-ons [http://elixir-lang.org/](on the code Editor Support section here). Or simply use [http://www.zohaib.me/spacemacs-and-alchemist-to-make-elixir-of-immortality/](Spacemacs and Alchemist).

### Documentation
You can find Elixir documentation [http://elixir-lang.org/](here).
Of course, Google remain your best friend.
